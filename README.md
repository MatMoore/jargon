## Previewing the API locally
First run `bundle exec rake build` from the root of the project, then navigate to the `build` directory.

You can preview the JSON in the browser by running `python -m http.server 8080` and browsing to `localhost:8080` (this requires python 3 to be installed).

The files are generated as `index.json` but github pages serves them as the root for that path. See [Making a JSON API with Github Pages](https://paulsalaets.com/posts/json-api-with-github-pages).

If you want to see what it looks like on github pages, you can fork the repo and run `bundle exec rake publish` to update the `gh-pages` branch.
