## Code of conduct
Please be nice on the internet. Not being nice may result in issues or PRs being closed.

## Coding conventions
- There are no strict conventions
- When in doubt, follow the [ruby style guide](https://github.com/rubocop-hq/ruby-style-guide)
- When changing existing code, create separate commits for any style changes, so it's easier to review the functional changes

## Testing
- There are no tests of the code
- If you want to write some, please go ahead!
